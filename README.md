## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   I did not use any outside resources, but I read through the extra javascript specifications on the prework website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

    There were so many new tools we used that were new to me. Also, javascript is very different than other languages we learned in the intro programming class. The Prework website explained the project step by step, so I was able to make it without having any bugs in my code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

    I have questions about people with disabilities, I got diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago, and my psychiatrist recommended that I play games just like this color game. This helps me to improve my focus and memorization.
    I LOVED HOW SMALL PROJECTS HELP PEOPLE TO OVERCOME LIFE OBSTACLES. I wonder how web development could be helpful for other disabilities.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

    I played the game many times and figured out it has the same sounds and lights. Suppose it was a different rhythm(lights) for each game; that would be very fun. I also would love to add more buttons other than four colors and maybe even make the game online so that you can compete with others. OR you make the sounds, and the other person tries to make the same sounds with the buttons.
